            <p class="text-lg text-text-light leading-relaxed mb-8">
                The Rehabilitation Center for Children (RCC) based in Winnipeg, Saskatchewan reached out to our program (Integrated Biomedical Engineering and Health Sciences at McMaster University) to help solve a variety of problems. One of which was the "All-in-one" visit model they had adopted shortly after Covid which condensed multiple appointments familes navigating their Assistive Technology program into a single day. While logistically sound there were silent issues including extended wait times in unwelcoming clinical rooms which caused stress, discomfort, and anxiety in their patients which is the opposite of the positive, holistic care the RCC wants to provide. This made our team’s goal clear, to take the existing waiting room’s stress, anxiety, and discomfort and transition it into a supportive, inclusive, and therapeutic environment that becomes an integral part of the care journey while upholding the dignity and compassion that make up the RCC’s foundational values.

            <p class="text-lg text-text-light leading-relaxed mb-8">
                Working together with Nicole Leclair and Shea Hunt from the RCC’s Assistive Technology Department, we identified the need for a scalable, comprehensive, and universally accessible solution that would fit each of the waiting rooms in the building. To address this our team came up with a custom high-tech modular divider system that comes with motion sensors for easy retractability, integrated soundproofing materials for a better sensory environment, and a built-on digital screen that can be used for entertainment or displaying helpful information.

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4 text-accent-blue">The Solution and Impact</h2>
            <p class="text-lg text-text-light leading-relaxed mb-8">
               In order to achieve this goal we had to meet several objectives that were ironed out with the help of Nicole and Shea. Most notably was a $5000 per room or $15,000 dollar total budget restraint for all necessary renovations and the divider fabrication. There was also a concern regarding continuity of care which restricted the time that the waiting room could be unavailable for a maximum of one month. The high-tech nature of the dividers also required the design to meet the quality standards for class I medical devices in Canada including monitored implementation and documentation to satisfy legal restrictions. The physical footprint of the dividers also had to conform to the RCC’s on-site fabrication capabilities which meant CNCing parts no greater than 4’x4’x12” and limiting the size of any 3D printed components. The room also had to meet Canada’s accessibility standards while still limiting external noise below 45dB. Ensuring our dividers met all of these criteria and more produced a final product that was accessible, conformine, technically feasible, fiscally responsible, and legally compliant. 
                
                The alternative plans that were considered were either using basic store-bought dividers to accomplish a cheaper version of the same function or a “do nothing” approach which would involve using the budget in a different area of the RCC. However, financial analysis strongly supported the more innovative, primary approach. Despite the largest initial cost, a potential annuity from selling the divider design to other healthcare facilities gave this approach the highest present worth of $32,300 over the five year analysis period. This greatly outperformed the $393 present worth of the alternative and the $0 present worth of the “do nothing” option.

            <p class="text-lg text-text-light leading-relaxed mb-8">
                While the economic analysis already provided a strong starting point the profound non-financial benefits of the high-tech divider plan only tipped the scales further in its favour. This included the large social gains as a result of the reduction in patient and family stress, time-saving benefits such as improvements in staff efficiency by automating information delivery, and the establishment of quality improvement in the RCC through industry-best practices such as painted murals and room theming. Furthermore, the primary plan benefits from indirect economic advantages such as economies of scale (a greater percent improvement in operation efficiency than percent increase in the number of rooms) and capital deepening through technological advancements. With all aspects considered from the superior economic analysis to the vital social and operation improvements, the implementation of the high-tech modular divider system was by far the most appropriate recommendation for the RCC.

                Working on this project taught me a lot about working with a team from a consulting perspective which is a vital skill for engineers to possess. It took a little while for our group to get comfortable but we quickly turned into an effective team where everyone knew their role and were very communicative and helpful. Despite being a project for a university course it felt uniquely realistic due to the considerations that had to be made including setting up external meetings with our client that I participated in. I also had hands-on experience with project management including defining the critical path for the primary action plan, I assisted in the calculations for the economic analysis of the project, and was the person who originally put forth the idea to design dividers after our initial concept was deemed too basic. 
                
                Thinking back to the first day things could have gone very differently as our group had half of its members changed after the first week, including a decision I made regarding which incoming group members we would get. I doubt that if my original group had stuck together we would have come up with the same solution. There were also over 30 unique project scopes that our team could have been responsible for, many of which might have been more related to our engineering specialties (mechatronics). While that would’ve made for a much smoother design process, I’m glad that the scope we received was so far outside of our engineering comfort zone because it made us do something unique and flex skills that we otherwise wouldn’t have had the chance to. Overall I’m glad that I had the chance to work on this unique project and I’m grateful that it went the way that it did since I feel that I learned a lot.
