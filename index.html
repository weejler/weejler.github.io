            <h2>Lessons Learned - Reflection </h2>
            <p>This design project was my first in person experience in over a year and it was initially difficult to readapt. Fortunately it provided a great chance to hone my group work after such an extended isolated period and through weekly milestones I learned how to cooperate as a teammember again. My 3MT also provided a great opporunity to work on my presentation skills which I took advantage of. I also developed my construction skills practising with many machines and tools such as the 3d printers and hot glue guns. My biggest shortcoming of the project was the start where I became far to busy far to quickly and ended up missing a submission. This taught me a valuable lesson in time managment and I have not made a simialr mistake since.</p>

              <h4 class="title"><a href="">Why did you approach the project how you did?</a></h4>
              <p class="description">Frequent group meetings and throwing myself into the assignment was a direct response to my initial lack of confidence following the pandemic.</p>

              <h4 class="title"><a href="">What's a stand out moment?</a></h4>
              <p class="description">For me the most exciting experience of the whole project was watching the 3d printer work. I've always considered them so high-tech that I wouldn't even understand how to use them. Who would've thought I'd use them in the first project!</p>

              <h4 class="title"><a href="">Why did you choose this solution?</a></h4>
              <p class="description">It's difficult to pin down exactly when the drainage idea became our main path forwards. I often find the solution to a design problem either jumps out at you like this project or, more commonly, requires many iterations and failures defore you see any form of success.</p>

              <h4 class="title"><a href="">What is your biggest takeaway?</a></h4>
              <p class="description">I used to be someone who vastly preferred to work by myself but this project taught me the value of teammates as I would have been completely unable to produce even a low-fidelity prototype by myself while balancing other course work.</p>

              <h4 class="title"><a href="">What if you had no impact on the outcome?</a></h4>
              <p class="description">If I hadn't been an active member of the group or been given any authority to make decisions the project would liekly look very different. Including a belt to help conceal the device and creating a vacuum sealed waste container were both ideas of mine heavily featured in the final design.</p>
            </div>

              <h4 class="title"><a href="">What if you could redo it?</a></h4>
              <p class="description">While I certainly put all my effort into the project the first time around I believe there is still room for improvement. Many of the good ideas that we had only appeared towards the end of the project and were left underexplored or never made as a result. Given the chance I would be sure to implement these features earlier on.</p>

            <h2>Lessons Learned - Reflection </h2>
            <p>While I certainly had my work cut out for me on the coding aspect of this project much of my most valuable learning experiences were more related to teamwork. I have long struggled to give up control within group projects but being relegated to the coding team forced me to simply have faith in what the modelling team could produce. Their success became my success and helped me confront my inability to give up control. On my own side of the project I overcame our biggest failure, a lack of clarity in instructions, by being proactive and reaching out to TAs to seek clarification. This helped prepare me for similar situations which occur often in real engineering work projects I hope to be a part of in the future.</p>

              <p class="description">The stand out moment for me would have to be the final presentation we did. It felt incredibly validating as a celebration of the culmination of our efforts over a month long period that happened on the very last day of the fall term.</p>

              <h4 class="title"><a href="">Why did you choose this solution?</a></h4>
              <p class="description">As a coder I wasn't very responsible for the creation of the physical solution. What I did contribute to were more general things such as material selection which left me in the dark as to how our final solution would look. Luckily it turned out very well and helped me increase my trust level, a very important attribute of group work.</p>

              <h4 class="title"><a href="">What is your biggest takeaway?</a></h4>
              <p class="description">My biggest takeaway is that every group member brings important qualities to the team. As a person who always prefers to lead, learning how to give up control is a valuable lesson. I learned that in DP2 by relying completely upon the modelling team to do their job with no input of mine whatsoever.</p>

              <h4 class="title"><a href="">What if you had no impact on the outcome?</a></h4>
              <p class="description">The coding program we made turned out to have very little correlation with the actual final deliverables. It felt rather demoralizing for my main project to be so unimportant but I worked past it and still helped by including my opinions by voting on general decisions.</p>

              <h4 class="title"><a href="">What if you could redo it?</a></h4>
              <p class="description">If there was the option to work on the modelling team instead I likely would choose it. Not only would it have forced me to develop my Autodesk Inventor skills (which were lacking at that point) but I would have produced work I could be more geniuenly poud of, which is important to me.</p>

            <h2>Lessons Learned - Reflection </h2>
            <p>This design project help me truly understand Autodesk Inventor and provided a great space to practise my hard skills. I modeled several complex, moving parts which taught me about unique features such as "shell" as well as motion constraints. I then learned about Autodesk's film making capabilities and created animations out of these models which were incorporated into a larger video I made in Davinci Resolve detailing the whole design process. These skills helped me overcome a failure, that being our 3D printed components not fitting properly during which I learned how to think on my feet, when to act, and how to avoid the trap of single solution thinking.</p>

              <p class="description">For this project I decided to reclaim my role as the leader albiet only extending to the modelling subteam. Since I wanted to improve at Autodesk I ended up doing the vast majority of the work and even created modeled designs for both our short term and long-term solutions. I am very pleased with the wuality of work I put forth.</p>

              <h4 class="title"><a href="">What's a stand out moment?</a></h4>
              <p class="description">This was undeniably the moment when we realised the case my partner 3D printed would not fit our Raspberry Pi. It was simultanouesly stressful and exicitng with a big portion of our marks up in the air. I thought quickly on my feet and managed to create a solution even better than what we had originally.</p>

              <h4 class="title"><a href="">Why did you choose this solution?</a></h4>
              <p class="description">As mentioned before, the solution we were able to make was based entirely on necessity and creating something that would work. The original idea for automating a baby gate was spawned out of a desire to make something unique and challenging which I believe we succeeded in doing.

              <p class="description">My biggest takeaway from this project is the importance of developing your personal skills as I believe I am at least partially responsible for saving a decent chunk of marks for the rest of my group. While they were absolutely paramount to completing everything to a high degree of quality that doesn't mean it's acceptable for me to just slack off when I can make an impact myself.</p>

              <h4 class="title"><a href="">What if you had no impact on the outcome?</a></h4>
              <p class="description">This design project is perhaps the one I had the biggest individual impact on. While the overall design was something the group agreed on, unique design features such as a bellcrank for button activation and the idea to have adjustable heights were personal contributions I made that radically changed the course of the project.</p>

              <h4 class="title"><a href="">What if you could redo it?</a></h4>
              <p class="description">One of the biggest problems that we faced was bloating the project. With a 90+ page design report taken up mostly by engineering drawings there is certainly a lot of room to cut down and free up time. If i could redo it knowing what I know now the overall solution might stay the same but I believe we could have spent this free time on creating a more visually striking design.</p>

            <h2>Lessons Learned - Reflection </h2>
            <p>While I didn't much get to flex my hard skills due to a lack of background expertise in sewing, I developed many important soft skills. As the leader of the more managerial side of the project I developed my communication skills, facilitating mutliple meetings and assuring that both attendees and those who couldn't make it were aware of our standing and their roles moving forward. I also furthered my creative thinking abilities by helping come up with the original idea and initial prototype that would serve as the basis for our future design iterations. I was also able to overcome a large obstacle and personal failure of mine in this project. I've long disagreed with the concept of meetings soley for the sake of updates and not progress but gradually grew to appreciate them for keeping me in the loop as to how the physical design was progressing.</p>

              <h4 class="title"><a href="">What's a stand out moment?</a></h4>
              <p class="description">The stand out moment for me was seeing our very first prototype. Seeing our idea come to life, work as we had designed, and appear as an incredibly high fidelity craft for just a concept was very validating and helped me find my passion for this project.</p>

              <h4 class="title"><a href="">Why did you choose this solution?</a></h4>
              <p class="description">While we intially started with a much larger pool of potential designs than any other project thus far, we rapidly narrowed down to the glove idea due to feasibility. Having a background in sewing and being able to modify an existing glove were key factors in our descision.</p>

              <h4 class="title"><a href="">What is your biggest takeaway?</a></h4>
              <p class="description">My biggest takeway from this project is the value that each person brings to a team. If this design project had gone another path then I would've never discovered my teammates' talent for sewing which is responsible for the sucess of this project. I think that if you're leading a group it's important to let people define themselves and if you're a member who has an idea it's important to advocate for it.</p>

              <h4 class="title"><a href="">What if you had no impact on the outcome?</a></h4>
              <p class="description">While not much would have changed with thew final design much of the scheduling and writing tasks would be different. I carried that burden to allow my other teammates to succeed and I believe that without my help the challenge would change from "will this work?" to "Can we finish this in time?"</p>

              <h4 class="title"><a href="">What if you could redo it?</a></h4>
              <p class="description">Given the chance to redo the project I might have taken my own advice and advocated more for the inclusion of my own skills. While I cannot sew I'm very useful on both Autodesk Inventor and Python and I feel as if I could have produced a mechanical/computer component to give our design a little more oomph.</p>
